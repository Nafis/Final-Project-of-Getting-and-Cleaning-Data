Code book of fiding a tidy data for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset###############################################################################

First we have to download the dataset. This dataset is in .zip so after unziping the dataset we can acsses to the data
We save it to our directry where we worked in, and it is easier to set the working directory on this while we work in R. by
 setwd("C:/Users/Pcs/Documents/R/galaxy/UCI HAR Dataset")

There are 5 steps that we have to follow to get to the tidy data according to the "Coursera final project" 
 
###  Step 1  

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
So after reading the two sorts of data sets, we merged them together.

###  Step 2 
 #Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 So after reading the datas which are concerned to features,  we select just the variables which their names include two words:
 "mean" and "std". after for making it more nicer we do some extra orders to have a huminy readable data.

##  Step 3 
 #Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 
 So we have to access to the activity files which is categorised in 6 different positions:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

 after we need to label every data in y_test and y_train and merge them at the end or vice versa
 

 
##step 4 
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.


 
##  step 5 
         
 #Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
