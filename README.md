This is the last project of the Course of Getting and Cleaning Data(Coursera) at Johns_Hopkins University.

Information about the dataset:

source: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

for more information please refer to "README.txt"

objective of this project is to have a tidy data with these conditions:

1-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The R codes are existed in the file called "run_analysis.R" and all the explanations are written in "code book".
